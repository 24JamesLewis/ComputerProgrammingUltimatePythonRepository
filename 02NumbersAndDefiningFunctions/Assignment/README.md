You should use some [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) to solve these problems.

1. `extremes.py`
   Prompt the user three times for three separate numbers. Print the largest of the three numbers, and the smallest of the three numbers.

2. `powers.py`
   Prompt the user for a base, and for an exponent. Then print the base to the power of the exponent. For example:

   | base | exponent | result |
   | ---- | -------- | ------ |
   | 2    | 3        | 8      |
   | 2    | 10       | 1024   |
   | 3    | 2        | 9      |

3. `tip_calculator.py`
   Prompt the user for the price of a meal, and then for a percent tip they want to leave. Then print the dollar amount they should tip. Format the result nicely. For example:

   | meal price | tip percent | tip amount |
   | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
   | $15.20     | 17%         | $2.58      |
   | $63.63     | 25%         | $15.91     |

4. `volume_functions.py`
   Write two functions: `shout` and `whisper`. Each should take one argument: a message to be printed. The `shout` function should print the message in uppercase, and periods should be replaced with exclamation points. The `whisper` function should print the message in lowercase, and any exclamation points should be replaced with periods.
